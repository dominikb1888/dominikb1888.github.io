Bending the world to your will is both exciting and exhausting. However, the reward of learning is tremendous. The mindset it takes to learn something new, I call "from scratch". In order to fully grasp the highly layered world around you, you need to exercise in peeling quite intensively. I would like to start peeling. Layer by layer. In the virtual and the real. From a mathematical and a visual perspective. Join me.

A lot of the inspiration for this blog has been sparked by the Toaster project of Tom Thwaites. Tom built a toaster from scratch. He went to dig for raw iron ore as well as buying crude oil. He went all the way back to where our value chains start. With more digital and less and less reliable value chains, I thought taking the journey from there is something worth doing. My first endeavours will be fully digital though and revolve a lot around programming and digital content. Later we will touch physical things a lot more.


## The world around us - mere surface

What we see around us is a surface. If you start peeling the white coating from your ikea furniture, you will discover that his is press board. The way from a tree to a press board is long. It is clear to everyone that it is and that a lot of intermediaries are involved in this process. The technical term would be the value chain. So the different stages of pre-production in between the raw product and the product on your shelves (or in your browser window ;-)). But where do we start? Is the origin of a piece of press board a tree or is it the farmer planting that tree in the first place? It is an important question, if we would like to dig deeper into the digital value chains. The scaffolding need to solve even the simplest of tasks is faceted and complex.

So, where do trees come from? In the wild obviously from other trees. Your piece of press board will with all likelhood have originated from a farm. So, just the wood is not our true origin. It would be the seeds and maybe a tool or a machine to seed them. How where the seeds produced and shipped? All sustainable and cradle to cradle or are there seed shops for trees on their journey to becoming press boards? Let's stop the real world examples. The first message is delivered. Defining the origin is not simple.


## The origin of the digital world

When in the process of computation, i.e. the boot process of an operating system do we not only speak about electrical current, but bits and bytes? This is when the real world (yes, electricity is real... it can hurt you) is virtualized and augmented. It is done by forming clever layers of modular systems on top of electrical switches etched into silicon chips. The core of this is the layered and modular nature. How many layers of software are you actually using when entering something into your browser? Let's dig into this!

So, now we could say let's make our lives easy. Most Operating systems start with a bootloader, then start the core layers, create the user space, and allow you to install a browser. Ok, done. Not so easy. That would be like saying there is the earth, streets, and cars, and a steering wheel. When trying to analyze this process and understand it from scratch, we need to take a good look into the whole toolchain involved.

- Level 1: Hardware abstraction
- Level 2: Core Operating system functionality
- Level 3: The User Space
- Level 4: The Browser
