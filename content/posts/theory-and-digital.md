# Do we still need Theory in the Digital World?

## Be honest. Wouldn't trial and error do?

I know. It is less talking, less writing and less arousal. But seriously. Most short and mid-term impact has been made by rather silent but even more bold weirdos that knew about science, but didn't glorify it. Can we really afford rigorous language games on a broad scale or should the talking academic as we know not long have been replace by the programming or building academic? If it cannot be prototyped, is it worth talking about it?Or should we only talk about things, if we cannot prototype them yet?

What I am trying to say is: If humanities don't contribute significantly with more than just words, will we not find better and richer folks to express wild ideas? Doesn't the blockchain embody independence in ways unseen so far? Doesn't a quantum computer signify the uber human in ways we hadn't been able to think about? Doesn't the digital transformation question all authorities in ways that weren't possible just 20 years ago?

My brief and bold claim: If you cannot wrap it in code, your are philosophizing or politicising. This way you are not directly constructively contributing to the advancement of society. We can be global, visionary, and specific at the same time. The journey from absurd induction to tangible deduction is as short as it has never been.

At the same time the profession as an influencer is countering this argument in so many ways. How can so many poeple live off of telling people about something they don't fully grasp. Wait, professors still exist - another story, another time. The question behind this is: Is this trend persistent or is this the last bounce of a dead cat?

After all. Why talk at all? We can test thoughts put into code globally in real time. The digital world is the biggest market of unfinished though we can imagine. At the moment, we exchange mainly materialistic things. I mean, who really needs that avocade-lime shower gel that super skinny instagram model just held lavishly into a camera. However, with the advent of the biorevolution - when all of our DNA is globally comparable in realtime - this will change to more substance.

What then? If the journey from though to embodiment is so brief. If we can express thought in organisms and have global competition about it. How far away are we from true programmatic evolution? How much sense does it make to transfer thought into a sign system, waste precious resources either paper or processing power. Let's directly build organisms that are self-sustainable and produce adaptively more complex variants by what their true purpose is: replication and mutation.

Imagine the history of philosophy was written by a biologist. Would we see many letters or rather many more bugs? At least here we can close the loop between the digital and the natural. The most common form of species in either the real or the digital ecology is the bug. A short-lived not entirely purposeful being. However, without them we also wouldn't know what to differentiate better code or higher forms of life from. It is a matter of perspective. Without having a impact neither bugs nor higher forms of life would exist. Let's stop focusing on talking only and start building. The way from thought to organism is as long and tedious as it took to put lead type into a printer's press in the 16th century.
