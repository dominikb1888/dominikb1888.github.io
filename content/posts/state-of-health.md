# The State of Health

The more prevention we see on our patient journey, the more we move from being a patient to being a citizen of a health state. Let me take you on the road from medicine being shamanist cult to the hyperforeseeing reality we are facing nowadays.

First let's get the wording straight. This book is not about medicine. It is about health. While the two concepts are often mixed up, they are fundamentally different. Health is a state and perhaps a goal - to some it yields prevention. Medicine is a profession and a cure to an existing sickness. One of the most argued things in medicine is the role of the doctor. Is he/she responsible for the health of their patients or is he/she an agent to promote health.

Let's just think about this for a moment. Would anybody want to be responsible for someone else's health? On the other hand would you like to consult someone about their health and just be liable for your recommendations? The first would most likely qualify as health insurance, the latter as a general practitioner. 

So, how has this system emerged the way it has? We do not need to look deep into the history of medicine. What's more interesting to our endeavour is the welfare state. While we may believe health has only been a very recent political instrument, it acutally has been around for quite a while.

Next to the welfare state and public health insurance another important element of the nation state was the promise of safety. In the 20th century this was mainly true for territorial safety. A promise that no foreign force would harm citizens or capture their property. With the advent of digitalization this changed. What we are witnessing today is a slow and steady meta-state being created by the large digital platforms. They keep personal profiles, interest and data from almost everyone around the globe. It is the biggest private investment in infrastructure seen yet.

The relevance of the nation state has diminished. If corporations can evade national tax schemes and if citizens can work and travel to and from everywhere, it is difficult to keep up traditional administrative processes. Even harder it is to claim a contribution to their success. What was the privilege of sucessful athletes throughout most of the 1980ie and 1990ies slowly turned to a mass movement. To put it sarcastically, if people can earn more money on instagram than in their regular jobs. What reason do they have to keep them and why would they need social security?

The notion of entrepreneurship, financial freedom and self-reliance harm both the traditional bureaucratic nation state and its healthcare system. If any transaction of resources can be made globally and real-time it is tough to keep up an organization that thinks in weeks and not milliseconds. The promise of the digital process is the power of directed incrementalism through real-time data. A hyperpersonalized world that settles any claim on the spot. A very bad time for accountants. However, if both nation state and healthcare system can not keep pace, what is the alternative?

We are in the process of building the prototype for it.
