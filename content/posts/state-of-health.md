# The State of Health

The more prevention we see on our patient journey, the more we move from being a patient to being a citizen of a health state. Let me take you on the road from medicine being shamanist cult to the hyperforeseeing reality we are facing nowadays.

First let's get the wording straight. This book is not about medicine. It is about health. While the two concepts are often mixed up, they are fundamentally different. Health is a state and perhaps a goal - to some it yields prevention. Medicine is a profession and a cure to an existing sickness. One of the most argued things in medicine is the role of the doctor. Is he/she responsible for the health of their patients or is he/she an agent to promote health.

Let's just think about this for a moment. Would anybody want to be responsible for someone else's health? On the other hand would you like to consult someone about their health and just be liable for your recommendations? The first would most likely qualify as health insurance, the latter as a general practitioner. 

So, how has this system emerged the way it has? We do not need to look deep into the history of medicine. What's more interesting to our endeavour is the welfare state. While we may believe health has only been a very recent political instrument, it acutally has been around for quite a while.
