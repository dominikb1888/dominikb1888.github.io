# Magic

Looking at the new album of Kings of Convenience was a must for me. However, looking at their approach and creative process as show in this documentary was even more of an inspiration than their music: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjau6qZKruE

One line by Eirik in this documentary says it all and should not only help artists, but everyone approaching their work and life (any difference, ey?) in an emotional and intuitive way. Aren't all truly great performances based on this after all?

Ok, ok, here are these lines:

Strings touching nails sometimes make ugly sounds.
You can't consciously create magic.
It has to happen at the moment when you let go.
It's a bit like falling asleep, you can't fall asleep.

# Learning Magic - One 1% for once

Often in business and especially in innovation management, I feel that we are merely touching the surface of intuitive action. Their are lots of people talking about magic, but few really practicing it so to say. One of the reasons may be that the social contracts we are living in our organizations defy intuition. Is it really true that reason kills creativity? Or is reason the reason for creativity? Another reason may reside in the competencies though. Not many people have been taught to embrace intuition. Schools (or universities...) are the worst place for this, few people really excel at music, art or sports. So, is our education system focussing on administering the medocricity of the masses? I don't think so. I even think it is very dangerous to think so. 


## The 1%

If we do believe in the decisive 1%. That last piece of sweat (or genius as you wish) truly great performances need, we need to assume that this greatness can also be achieved by anybody at any moment in time. Heureka moments are not following a standard normal distribution. 

## The One

Next to the power of the 1%, our organizations often underestimate the power of the "one". One person on a mission, can change the face of the planet. You cannot infuse intrinsic action, there may be surroundings to nurture this. However, rarely they are truly seen anywhere outside early-stage start-ups. 

## The Once

Just as trying to capture time, creativity cannot be repeated. Momentum is as much part of the creative process as anything else. 

# Practicing Magic

So, how can we deliberately pass on the craft of magic to others? Can it be taught? Certainly not in a traditional sense. Telling people about magic and the statistical facts it is bound to, will a most create attention, maybe astonishment. What it needs though is action. A flipped model of teaching. Yes, there is flipped classroom as a didactic method to help encourage this. But just turning the classroom on its head within the meta-theoretical framework of lecturing as teaching will not cut it. We need to embrace an action-oriented approach right from the start. The boundary conditions actually matter a lot more than the actual content. 

The question is how can we create environments that encourage people to attempt hearing nails touching strings, how can we be a mentor on the way to more disciplined perfection? Certainly not when we face a group sitting in front of listening or trying to engage in a rational argument. We can raise clerks or politicians that way - both of which the world has more than enough (I didn't say good ones!). There's also the option to spit out the one or the other strategy consultant. What all three types have in common though they do not really stand out for being risk-taking or inspirational. Can we expect great works for art, design, or entrepreneurship from them? 


## Experiential and project-based learning

The changing moment in my learning journey was a reflection I did relatively early in my studies. Being self-employed as a web developer taught me a lot more (and a lot more interesting things) than anything I had heard at university back then. It was real, personal, and full of pressure and risk. I made good projects and terrible ones. I would always learn though, because I was in the field and the learning experience was taylored by me (not to me!). In fact, without knowing it I always practiced learning-by-earning.

How to implement these ideas in a curriculum? It is simple: Provide real-world challenges and regular feedback. At best students bring their own entrepreneurial projects. Sometimes it is nice to encourgae directions into certain markets or technologies. What it needs in addition is resource abundance. Access to workshops, prototyping materials, industry experts, and maybe even a little budget. 


## True Entrepreneurs will stay

You may say that this doesn't raise true entrepreneurs. They would overcome all these boundaries anyways. I am with you. However, most of what is taught in entrepreneurship education is not entrepreneurship. From my experience it is self-reflection and team work. Increase the frequency of these two elements by offering many project settings to learn from is key. The true entrepreneurs will stay even after failing over and over again. The others will be a lot clearer about which job to get. All of them will know which magic tricks they feel comfortable in performing.
