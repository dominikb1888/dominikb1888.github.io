# Magic

Looking at the new album of Kings of Convenience was a must for me. However, looking at their approach and creative process as show in this documentary was even more of an inspiration than their music: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjau6qZKruE

One line by Eirik in this documentary says it all and should not only help artists, but everyone approaching their work and life (any difference, ey?) in an emotional and intuitive way. Aren't all truly great performances based on this after all?

Ok, ok, here are these lines:

Strings touching nails sometimes make ugly sounds.
You can't consciously create magic.
It has to happen at the moment when you let go.
It's a bit like falling asleep, you can't fall asleep.

# Learning Magic - One 1% for once

Often in business and especially in innovation management, I feel that we are merely touching the surface of intuitive action. Their are lots of people talking about magic, but few really practicing it so to say. One of the reasons may be that the social contracts we are living in our organizations defy intuition. Is it really true that reason kills creativity? Or is reason the reason for creativity? Another reason may reside in the competencies though. Not many people have been taught to embrace intuition. Schools (or universities...) are the worst place for this, few people really excel at music, art or sports. So, is our education system focussing on administering the medocricity of the masses? I don't think so. I even think it is very dangerous to think so. 


## The 1%

If we do believe in the decisive 1%. That last piece of sweat (or genius as you wish) truly great performances need, we need to assume that this greatness can also be achieved by anybody at any moment in time. Heureka moments are not following a standard normal distribution. 

## The One

Next to the power of the 1%, our organizations often underestimate the power of the "one". One person on a mission, can change the face of the planet. You cannot infuse intrinsic action, there may be surroundings to nurture this. However, rarely they are truly seen anywhere outside early-stage start-ups. 

## The Once

Just as trying to capture time, creativity cannot be repeated. Momentum is as much part of the creative process as anything else.
