Digital Services are neither essential nor existential. Medical Services are essential and existential. In a digital world both digital and medical services blend. This creates issues in our perception of product development, reimbursement and HCP incentives.

## Essential and Existential

Something is essential, if it is "constituting or being part of the nature or essence of something".

Something is existential, if it is "relating to or affirming existence".

Digital Services in Healthcare are neither essential nor existential, because they do not essentially belong to the art and craft of doing medicine. They can be of great value, but we have been doing without for centuries. They might be deemed essential, if we focus on health economic principles and the accessibility and efficiency of healthcare systems.

However, the current focus in regulatory approval and reimbursement centers around the notion of the existential. A device is medically relevant, if it can - based on evidence - contribute to mitigating symptoms or root causes of an indication. It does not so much focus on how this device can be accesses and contributes to higher level efficiency of the healthcare system.

The current health economic principle is focussing on opportunity cost not system cost. The external effects of non-treatment and prevention are not factored into the direct evaluation of efficacy of medical devices. This hits digital solutions particularly hard.

A good digital solution is focused creating value by reconfiguring value chains and reaping the benefits of data analytics from distributed networks of actors. Google improved search by analyzing the topology of the web (Which site is important based on existing links?) and combining this with user behaviour (Which site is actually clicked on?). The current revolution of the digital would not be thinkable, if the YAHOO approach of cataloging would have prevailed.

The take-away: no system based on exclusive or partially overlapping categories is capable of matching the complexity of the world.

* In fact, following this idea, we should be mining diseases from data and not from HCP categorizations. For this we would need data. Let's revisit this thought in a decade.

From this example, we can learn a few things about how digital and healthcare currently do not fit together and what we might need to focus on to fix this:


1. Focusing on evidence in product development only does not factor in the inherently social nature of digital products. Every digital product is a social network. If my product is not based on the automated analysis of data from distributed users, it could well have lived before the advent of the web. It is software, but not a good digital product.

2. Based on this idea, it is clear that a good digital health solution needs to combine both features with clear medical evidence and features without. Currently, providers of digital solutions are barely reimbursed for the features directly contributing to evidence. Adding more features would need healthcare systems to focus more on outcomes, less on costs. The power of data will allow us to not treat every treatment the same. Without value-based healthcare, there are not enough incentives for solution providers to create the needed effects to improve the efficiency on care paths.

3. On the flipside, this needs to create the same incentives on the side of the HCPs. While it might be an easy solution to demand collaboration in distributed networks, the distribution of contributors and readers in social network is not Gaussian. The old formula was 90% lurkers and 10% writers. Why should medical professionals deviate much from this statistic? We might obvioulsy force them to contribute. However, given the shortage of qualified staff in many health systems, mechanisms that build on trust and incentives seem better suited. The question is: Who should trust and who should pay. Reconfiguring the way Insurers, Producers and Patients contribute to this reimbursement needs a thought.
