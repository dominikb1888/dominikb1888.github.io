# A view on Germany

With a bit of delay Germany is approaching the age of digital health. With the advent of digital storage of patient records and e-prescription services new forms of ambulant care are suddenly imaginable. 

This currently brings up activist groups on Twitter claiming patients' data was under severe threat (Follow #PatientenDatenInGefahr). Following these threads go me thinking. We are talking about patient data as a sacred good here most of the time. However, what is health data, what is healthcare data, and what is patient data? 

Health Data: Any item of data interpreted with a focus on personal or public health.

Healthcare Data: Data stemming from treatment(s) in health organizations or being collected with the means of medical devices.

Patient Data: Patient Data is most commonly referred to when a third party is performing operations on one or many individuals data, e.g. passing it on electronically.

What these three definitions share is that they all relate to the individual when analyzing that data. This is contrast to medical research data, where usually the individual is only of secondary interest. Data here is not individual but mostly pseudonymized.

Why are these distinctions important? Because medical activities obviously see a danger for patient data. So, when data is collected in a private scenario of trust. We can all imagine that especially in psychotherapy, we expect very high levels of trust.

With a centralized (and partly enforced) system of healthcare data storage through third parties (making it patient data ;-)) obviously not only the doctor-patient relationship is affected, but also the relationship of the patient with other stakeholder in the system. We refer to this as intersectoral.

Obviously, this is not just a mere change in communication media, but a sever shift if how care processes are being delivered. The current role of practitioners both generalized and specialized will change. Dramatically. If patients want that. Patients still control their patient journey. However where that starts is crucial. [^1]

We are witnessing a similar shift as in retial 20 years ago when Amazon was approaching and was doomed by small retailers. In many instance the situation in ambulant care resembles that situation. Many small unprepared individuals in their doctors' offices are waiting for patients. Most likely many of them will wait for good, if change and better networking are not on the horizon. 

The first step to change is a change of mind. And fundamental shift we have to acknowledge is that the sole focus on Patients and Patient data is not enough anymore, if I would like to become an agent of better health. Not just the mitigation of misery.

However, what are the pitfalls? What does it mean if we focus our health efforts on not-yet-patients. You may also call that prevention. Are we going to end-up in the matrix or a minority report? Will we hail to Big Brothers and Soma suddenly? Will we all be sick all the time because healthcare became so precise as Aldous Huxley famously stated?

Doomsday is near. Or not. It is upon us to build technology and design processes that are human and thus further freedom. Maybe especially in healthcare this should be obvious. Apparently it is not.

# Citizens as Patients?

But let's assume all of us are merely Patients. All Citizenship is attached to health status. Would we want that? Would we prefer health or freedom? Should we need to choose? Big questions. We discussed them a myriad of times during the Corona-Pandemic (Should I wear a mask, stay at home, vaccinate, ...). 

Now currently, we are in exception mode (hopefully). What if the new normal is not only relating to web conferences and digitalization of the state though? Will we end up in authoritarian health regimes? Only healthy people... oh no please stop it.

What are the effects of prevention on societies? How much fear may we have? It is a personal question of risk perception unfortunately.
