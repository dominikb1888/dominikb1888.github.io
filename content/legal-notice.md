  <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>Personal data (usually referred to just as "data" below) will only be processed by us to the extent necessary and
    for the purpose of providing a functional and user-friendly website, including its contents, and the services
    offered there.</p>
  <p>Per Art. 4 No. 1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, i.e. the General Data Protection Regulation (hereinafter referred to
    as the "GDPR"), "processing" refers to any operation or set of operations such as collection, recording,
    organization, structuring, storage, adaptation, alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by
    transmission, dissemination, or otherwise making available, alignment, or combination, restriction, erasure, or
    destruction performed on personal data, whether by automated means or not.</p>
  <p>The following privacy policy is intended to inform you in particular about the type, scope, purpose, duration, and
    legal basis for the processing of such data either under our own control or in conjunction with others. We also
    inform you below about the third-party components we use to optimize our website and improve the user experience
    which may result in said third parties also processing data they collect and control.</p>
  <p>Our privacy policy is structured as follows:</p>

  <p>
  I. Information about us as controllers of your data<br>
  II. The rights of users and data subjects<br>
  III. Information about the data processing
  </p>

  <h3>I. Information about us as controllers of your data</h3>
  <p>The party responsible for this website (the "controller") for purposes of data protection law is:</p>

  <p>The controller's data protection officer is:</p>
  <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Dominik Böhler</span></p>
 
  <h3>II. The rights of users and data subjects</h3>
  <p>With regard to the data processing to be described in more detail below, users and data subjects have the right</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>to confirmation of whether data concerning them is being processed, information about the data being processed,
      further information about the nature of the data processing, and copies of the data (cf. also Art. 15 GDPR);</li>
    <li>to correct or complete incorrect or incomplete data (cf. also Art. 16 GDPR);</li>
    <li>to the immediate deletion of data concerning them (cf. also Art. 17 DSGVO), or, alternatively, if further
      processing is necessary as stipulated in Art. 17 Para. 3 GDPR, to restrict said processing per Art. 18 GDPR;</li>
    <li>to receive copies of the data concerning them and/or provided by them and to have the same transmitted to other
      providers/controllers (cf. also Art. 20 GDPR);</li>
    <li>to file complaints with the supervisory authority if they believe that data concerning them is being processed
      by the controller in breach of data protection provisions (see also Art. 77 GDPR).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In addition, the controller is obliged to inform all recipients to whom it discloses data of any such corrections,
    deletions, or restrictions placed on processing the same per Art. 16, 17 Para. 1, 18 GDPR. However, this obligation
    does not apply if such notification is impossible or involves a disproportionate effort. Nevertheless, users have a
    right to information about these recipients.</p>
  <p><strong>Likewise, under Art. 21 GDPR, users and data subjects have the right to object to the controller's future
      processing of their data pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. In particular, an objection to data processing
      for the purpose of direct advertising is permissible.</strong></p>
  <h3>III. Information about the data processing</h3>
  <p>Your data processed when using our website will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose for its storage ceases
    to apply, provided the deletion of the same is not in breach of any statutory storage obligations or unless
    otherwise stipulated below.</p>
  <h4>Server data</h4>
  <p>For technical reasons, the following data sent by your internet browser to us or to our server provider will be
    collected, especially to ensure a secure and stable website: These server log files record the type and version of
    your browser, operating system, the website from which you came (referrer URL), the webpages on our site visited,
    the date and time of your visit, as well as the IP address from which you visited our site.</p>
  <p>The data thus collected will be temporarily stored, but not in association with any other of your data.</p>
  <p>The basis for this storage is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in the improvement,
    stability, functionality, and security of our website.</p>
  <p>The data will be deleted within no more than seven days, unless continued storage is required for evidentiary
    purposes. In which case, all or part of the data will be excluded from deletion until the investigation of the
    relevant incident is finally resolved.</p>
  <h4>Cookies</h4>
  <h5>a) Session cookies</h5>
  <p>We use cookies on our website. Cookies are small text files or other storage technologies stored on your computer
    by your browser. These cookies process certain specific information about you, such as your browser, location data,
    or IP address. &nbsp;</p>
  <p>This processing makes our website more user-friendly, efficient, and secure, allowing us, for example, to display
    our website in different languages or to offer a shopping cart function.</p>
  <p>The legal basis for such processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR, insofar as these cookies are used to collect
    data to initiate or process contractual relationships.</p>
  <p>If the processing does not serve to initiate or process a contract, our legitimate interest lies in improving the
    functionality of our website. The legal basis is then Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR.</p>
  <p>When you close your browser, these session cookies are deleted.</p>
  <h5>b) Third-party cookies</h5>
  <p>If necessary, our website may also use cookies from companies with whom we cooperate for the purpose of
    advertising, analyzing, or improving the features of our website.</p>
  <p>Please refer to the following information for details, in particular for the legal basis and purpose of such
    third-party collection and processing of data collected through cookies.</p>
  <h5>c) Disabling cookies</h5>
  <p>You can refuse the use of cookies by changing the settings on your browser. Likewise, you can use the browser to
    delete cookies that have already been stored. However, the steps and measures required vary, depending on the
    browser you use. If you have any questions, please use the help function or consult the documentation for your
    browser or contact its maker for support. Browser settings cannot prevent so-called flash cookies from being set.
    Instead, you will need to change the setting of your Flash player. The steps and measures required for this also
    depend on the Flash player you are using. If you have any questions, please use the help function or consult the
    documentation for your Flash player or contact its maker for support.</p>
  <p>If you prevent or restrict the installation of cookies, not all of the functions on our site may be fully usable.
  </p>
  <h4>Order processing</h4>
  <p>The data you submit when ordering goods and/or services from us will have to be processed in order to fulfill your
    order. Please note that orders cannot be processed without providing this data.</p>
  <p>The legal basis for this processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR.</p>
  <p>After your order has been completed, your personal data will be deleted, but only after the retention periods
    required by tax and commercial law.</p>
  <p>In order to process your order, we will share your data with the shipping company responsible for delivery to the
    extent required to deliver your order and/or with the payment service provider to the extent required to process
    your payment.</p>
  <h5>The legal basis for the transfer of this data is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR.</h5>
  <h4>Customer account/registration</h4>
  <p>If you create a customer account with us via our website, we will use the data you entered during registration
    (e.g. your name, your address, or your email address) exclusively for services leading up to your potential
    placement of an order or entering some other contractual relationship with us, to fulfill such orders or contracts,
    and to provide customer care (e.g. to provide you with an overview of your previous orders or to be able to offer
    you a wishlist function). We also store your IP address and the date and time of your registration. This data will
    not be transferred to third parties.</p>
  <p>During the registration process, your consent will be obtained for this processing of your data, with reference
    made to this privacy policy. The data collected by us will be used exclusively to provide your customer
    account.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>If you give your consent to this processing, Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a) GDPR is the legal basis for this processing.
  </p>
  <p>If the opening of the customer account is also intended to lead to the initiation of a contractual relationship
    with us or to fulfill an existing contract with us, the legal basis for this processing is also Art. 6 Para. 1 lit.
    b) GDPR.</p>
  <p>You may revoke your prior consent to the processing of your personal data at any time under Art. 7 Para. 3 GDPR
    with future effect. All you have to do is inform us that you are revoking your consent.</p>
  <p>The data previously collected will then be deleted as soon as processing is no longer necessary. However, we must
    observe any retention periods required under tax and commercial law.</p>
  <h4>Credit checks and scores</h4>
  <p>If you accept any offer we make for you to pay for goods or services on account, we reserve the right to run a
    credit check with a credit bureau (such as Creditreform, Schufa, Bürgel, or infoscore) to obtain credit information
    determined on the basis of mathematical-statistical methods. For this purpose, any data you provide that is relevant
    to the contract, such as your name and address, will be forwarded to the credit bureau. We then use the information
    obtained about the statistical probability of default to decide whether we will offer you payment on account.</p>
  <p>The legal basis for such processing is our legitimate interest to avoid default on our account per Art. 6 Para.1
    lit. f) GDPR.</p>
  <h4>Newsletter</h4>
  <p>If you register for our free newsletter, the data requested from you for this purpose, i.e. your email address and,
    optionally, your name and address, will be sent to us. We also store the IP address of your computer and the date
    and time of your registration. During the registration process, we will obtain your consent to receive this
    newsletter and the type of content it will offer, with reference made to this privacy policy. The data collected
    will be used exclusively to send the newsletter and will not be passed on to third parties.</p>
  <p>The legal basis for this is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a) GDPR.</p>
  <p>You may revoke your prior consent to receive this newsletter under Art. 7 Para. 3 GDPR with future effect. All you
    have to do is inform us that you are revoking your consent or click on the unsubscribe link contained in each
    newsletter.</p>
  <h4>Contact</h4>
  <p>If you contact us via email or the contact form, the data you provide will be used for the purpose of processing
    your request. We must have this data in order to process and answer your inquiry; otherwise we will not be able to
    answer it in full or at all.</p>
  <p>The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR.</p>
  <p>Your data will be deleted once we have fully answered your inquiry and there is no further legal obligation to
    store your data, such as if an order or contract resulted therefrom.</p>
  <h4>User posts, comments, and ratings</h4>
  <p>We offer you the opportunity to post questions, answers, opinions, and ratings on our website, hereinafter referred
    to jointly as "posts." If you make use of this opportunity, we will process and publish your post, the date and time
    you submitted it, and any pseudonym you may have used.</p>
  <p>The legal basis for this is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a) GDPR. You may revoke your prior consent under Art. 7 Para. 3
    GDPR with future effect. All you have to do is inform us that you are revoking your consent.</p>
  <p>In addition, we will also process your IP address and email address. The IP address is processed because we might
    have a legitimate interest in taking or supporting further action if your post infringes the rights of third parties
    and/or is otherwise unlawful.</p>
  <p>In this case, the legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in any legal defense we
    may have to mount.</p>

  <p>If you make posts on our website, we also offer you the opportunity to subscribe to any subsequent follow-up
    comments made by third parties. In order to be able to inform you about these follow-up comments, we will need to
    process your email address.</p>
  <p>The legal basis for this is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a) GDPR. You may revoke your prior consent to this subscription
    under Art. 7 Para. 3 GDPR with future effect. All you have to do is inform us that you are revoking your consent or
    click on the unsubscribe link contained in each email.</p>
  <h4>Online job applications / publication of job advertisements</h4>
  <p>We offer you the opportunity to apply for jobs with our company via our website. In the case of these digital
    applications, we collect your application data electronically in order to process your application.</p>
  <p>The legal basis for this processing is §26 Para. 1 S. 1 BDSG in conjunction with Art. 88 Para. 1 GDPR.</p>
  <p>If you are hired as a result of the application process, we will store the data you provide during the application
    process in your personnel file for the purpose of the usual organizational and administrative process, naturally in
    compliance with further legal obligations.</p>
  <p>The legal basis for this processing is §26 Para. 1 S. 1 BDSG in conjunction with Art. 88 Para. 1 GDPR.</p>
  <p>If we do not hire you, we will automatically delete the data submitted to us two months after the final decision is
    made. We will not delete the data, however, if we must store the data for legal reasons such as evidence of equal
    treatment of applicants, until any legal action is concluded, or four months.</p>
  <p>In this case, the legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR and §24 Para. 1 No. 2 BDSG. Our legitimate interest
    lies in any legal defense we may have to mount .</p>
  <p>If you expressly consent to a longer storage of your data, e.g. for your inclusion in a database of applicants or
    interested parties, the data will be processed further on the basis of your consent. The legal basis is then Art. 6
    Para. 1 lit. a) GDPR. You may withdraw your consent at any time with future effect per Art. 7 Para. 3 GDPR with
    future effect.</p>
  <h4>Contests</h4>
  <p>We offer you the opportunity to take part in contests on our website. If you participate in one of our

    goods or to a financial service provider if the transfer is necessary for the delivery or payment of your winnings.
    If you win and your information is to be published, you will be informed of this in the declaration of consent.</p>
  <p>The legal basis for the transfer of this data is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR.</p>
  <p>Your consent to the processing of your data for participation in our competitions may be exercised in accordance
