# Digital, Health, and Entrepreneurship

I am a professor for digital health, business angel, and strategic advisor. I support digital health entrepreneurs in the Munich ecosystem (and beyond). Here you will find my thoughts on current issues in the entrepreneurial ecosystem, novel approaches in digital healthcare, and lots of discoveries I make on the way.
